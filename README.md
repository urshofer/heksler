# heksler
Heksler is a simple video slicer designed for speed. After setting in- and out-points, heckler transcodes and exports the slice. Heksler also has a cut detection or shot transition feature.

Compatibility
-------------

Heksler runs on osx. The source is built with openFrameworks and uses ffmpeg to transcode the video, so it would be easy to port it to other operating systems.
